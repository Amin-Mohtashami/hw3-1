Now, your job is to edit words.c to make it create multiple threads (at least 4)
to to fetch words from the input file and insert them into the dictionary.
Create in your repository a file called pwords.c that will contain the code of
your threaded solution. In writing pwords.c, try to reuse as much code from
words.c as you can. Your dictionary should be protected by a mutex that
synchronizes access to your dictionary by multiple threads. To build your
program, you can use the makefile we provided for you. Once you’re done and have
tested your work, you might want to compare the speed of execution of the sequential
and threaded solutions on your machine. Once you’re done, execute!
